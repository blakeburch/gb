# FAQs

## How can I get access to Shipyard?

If you want to start using Shipyard, you will need to reach out to us directly. There are 3 easy ways to do this:

1. Send an email to [onboarding@shipyardapp.com](mailto:onboarding@shipyardapp.com)
2. Send us a message via Intercom by clicking the chat bubble to your right.
3. Visit [this page ](https://www.shipyardapp.com/request-access)and fill out the form with your contact information.

After contacting us, we will follow up with you to schedule a brief 15 minute call. We want to take this time to better understand your pain points, potential use cases, and ensure that you can get started on the right foot.  
  
After our conversation, we'll begin the process of creating your account. As a follow-up, we're also happy to provide a brief personalized demo of the platform or just let you explore on your own.

## Can I create an account on my own?

No. We currently don't offer the ability to create an account on your own. We want to work closely with those that are using the platform so you can be set up for success \(and so we can also weed out potential bad actors at this stage\).

We promise we don't bite, so feel free to reach out if you'd like an account. üòÅ 

## How do I submit feedback or a feature request?

We love to hear what our users would like to see out of our product. Feel free to reach us at any time through intercom \(the chat bubble on the right\) or by sending an email directly to [support@shipyardapp.com](mailto:support@shipyardapp.com)

## What programming languages do you support?

We currently natively support the creation of solutions using Python 3 and Bash. Bash allows us to theoretically support any language non-natively, where the right language packages just need to be manually installed by the user.

In the future, we plan to expand our native language support to R and Node.js.

If you have a language that you would like to see supported, let us know!

## What skills do I need to get started with Shipyard?

Shipyard is a workflow automation sandbox for technical team members. As long as you know how to write a little bit of code in Python or Bash, you can build and launch almost anything that doesn't need a UI. We've made the platform as easy as possible for you to take your existing coding skills, no matter how complex they are, and solve problems at scale.

As long as you have at least one technical team member that can initially build solutions for the organization, other users of Shipyard are **not** required to know code. We built the platform to allow business users the ability to easily access and take advantage of internally built solutions \([Custom Blueprints](https://intercom.help/shipyardapp/en/articles/3526186-what-is-a-custom-blueprint)\).  
  
We are not comparable to no-code tools like [Zapier](http://www.zapier.com) and [Tray.io.](http://Tray.io) We don't provide any plug-and-play connections to existing 3rd party services, but do plan on providing some ready-to-use Starter Blueprints in the future.

If you have an idea of something you want to solve, and you're not sure if it's possible with Shipyard, reach out to us!

## How much does Shipyard cost to use?

We are currently not charging users to use our platform while we work to refine our product offering to be truly seamless and exceptional. Our main objective right now is to help companies scale their existing automation processes without them needing to worry about infrastructure. In return, we want these users to provide us with valuable feedback that helps shape the platform for the foreseeable future.

Even though the product is currently free, we are committed to providing the highest level of service, product uptime, and availability. We acknowledge that we will be helping facilitate mission-critical jobs and will be doing

We expect that we will begin charging users in Q2 or Q3 of 2020 and plan on offering the product as a monthly subscription service.

## What Technology Stack do you use?

Shipyard was built from the ground-up using Go for all of the backend code. 

Our frontend is entirely designed using Node, React.js, and the Ant Design framework.

All of our cloud infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.

For a more detailed view at the technology we use across the company, see our [StackShare profile](https://stackshare.io/shipyard/shipyard).

## Why should I use Shipyard over Open-Source Software solutions?

Our team are big believers in OSS. We even use some of it to build out our own services \(and contribute to some projects in this way\)! However, relying on OSS can present it's own challenges when something isn't working. To fix the problem, you'll either have to wait for someone else to prioritize the bug, or develop workarounds on your own.  
  
By making Shipyard a platform that prioritizes payment, we're able to provide customers with a high level of service and reaction time to fixing any bugs that may arise. You'll spend less development time wrangling with setup, troubleshooting, and constant adjustments of infrastructure. If you need a feature to help support your business, we can work with you to build it. We believe that trade-off is worth it for any business serious about implementing automation and using their data for the long term.
