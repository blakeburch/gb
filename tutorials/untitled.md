# Build a Playground Project

For the sake of all of our tutorials, we suggest creating a new project called "Playground". This will serve as an area for you to freely explore the functionality of Shipyard without the fear of affecting anything else in the platform.

### Creating your "Playground" Project

1. Using the navigation on the left-side of the screen, click on "Projects". This will cause the navigation menu to expand.
2. Click on **View All Projects**. This will take you to the "All Projects" page.  
  
   If this is your first time in the platform, you'll see the following screen:
