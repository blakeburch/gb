# On Demand Triggers

## Definition

On the main page for every Vessel, you are given the option to click "Run Now". Clicking this button will cause the Vessel to save changes and trigger a Vessel to schedule an immediate run.  


## Limitations

1. Vessels may not run instantaneously, as there is still time associated with spinning up a server.
