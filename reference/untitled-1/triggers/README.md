# Triggers

## Definition

Triggers are the logic that determines when a Vessel begins running. Triggers can be mixed and matched, and even happen simultaneously. Triggers are set on the "Set Schedule" step or tab of a Vessel.  
  
On the Shipyard platform, there are currently 3 types of triggers.

* Schedule Triggers
* Internal Triggers
* On Demand Triggers

## Limitations

1. There is currently no way to view the overlap between multiple types of triggers.
