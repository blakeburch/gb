# Vessels

## Definition

A Vessel is the "unit of work" in Shipyard, or an individual script that has been designed and built to accomplish a very specific job. Just like the real world equivalent, Vessels can be any size, shape, or speed, and built for any purpose. 

Every Vessel is built with a Blueprint that contains the design specifications that determine what that Vessel does. Building a new Vessel will walk you through a multi-step setup wizard. The steps required for creating a New Vessel differ based on the type of Blueprint that you select:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Code Blueprint Steps" %}
1. Select your **Blueprint**
2. Provide **Code**
3. Define **Requirements**
4. Set **Triggers**
5. Save **Settings**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Custom Blueprint Steps" %}
1. Select your **Blueprint**
2. Fill out **Form**
3. Set **Triggers**
4. Save **Settings**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Limitations

1. A Vessel can only be tied to one Blueprint, one Project, and one Organization.
2. A Vessel's Blueprint cannot be changed once it is created.
3. A Vessel's Project cannot be changed once it is created.
4. A Vessel is not version controlled. Any changes made directly in the Vessel creation pages cannot be visualized or restored.
