# Blueprints

## Definition

Blueprints are the foundation for every Vessel. They contain the design specifications needed to start building solutions for your organization. As such, they live at the organization level and can be used for any Project.

There are 2 main types of Blueprints:

### **Code Blueprints**

Write and run code from scratch, executed on our scaled cloud infrastructure. Currently supported languages are Python and Bash.

### **Custom Blueprints**

Create templated solutions that anyone in the organization can use without needing code. A Blueprint Creator will decide what inputs a user should fill out, while a Blueprint User will provide the relevant information.
