# Projects

## Definition

A project is a flexible way to categorize everything that your organization is actively working on. You can use this to separate work for individual clients, vendors, or internal teams.  


## Stored Data

Projects store the following data about themselves. 

| Name | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Organization | The company or organization that the project belongs to. |
| Name | The display name that is shown to all users. |
| Timezone | The timezone that all Voyages are scheduled in. **** |

## Limitations

1. Vessels cannot be moved between projects in the UI right now, so you'll want to make sure that you internally agree on the setup as a team. If you need to move a Vessel to a new project reach out to support.
2. Vessels in one project cannot interact with a Vessel or a Fleet in another project.
3. Vessels cannot be scheduled to run in any timezone other than the project's selected timezone. It is currently not possible to mix timezones within a single project.
4. A project cannot be shared between two organizations. If you would like to give an external member access to Vessels within a project, you'll need to add them to your organization and give them access to that project.
