# User Permissions

## Definition

Admins have the ability to fine-tune control for every user in an organization. Permissions are split into two components:

### **Access Settings**

Define whether a user can View, Edit, Create, and Delete the four core elements of Shipyard \(Users, Projects, Vessels, Blueprints\).

### **Project Access**

Select all of the projects which a user can access. Project names are automatically completed as you type them.

## Limitations

1. Access settings are applied at the Organization level. In other words, a selected setting will apply to every project that a user has access to.
